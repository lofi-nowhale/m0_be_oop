# Self-Evaluation

- **This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?**
This felt really good! It was nice to get to pull all learning into one place, and gave me more confidence in what I've learned as well as my recall. I'm eager to do more projects to practice and keep these skills and to learn more skills to add on.

-**How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?**
I think my workflow as far as staying focused and working through problems is really good, but my break workflow is not great just yet, I get really in the zone for a project or problem and then forget that a break would be helpful. I'm working on creating systems for myself to help me take breaks more often!
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
The biggest thing from this that i want to take is class and method syntax and how to make everything clean and easy to read. I found myself fogetting `end` here and there and neededing to go back through and find where it was missing. I think if I can start with a really good grasp on clean code and proper syntax, it will help with learning bigger concepts more smoothly!
